Aggregating to the country level there is a positive relationship between 
loneliness and MH problems in all countries (first graph) and there appears
to be a strong positive relationship between the level of MH problems and levels 
of loneliness across countries. But there very large differences between 
countries.  Vietnam has ~20% of young people having MH problems and loneliness,
US, Ireland, Iraq and Chile have >60%.

```{r}
#| echo: false
d <- orig_dat
names(d) <- tolower(names(d)) 
d <- d %>% dplyr::mutate(
  global_region = as.character(global_region),
  gender = as.character(gender),
  gender = ifelse(gender %in% c("Male", "Female"), gender, NA),
  youth = age_group == "18-24 years old",
  youth = ifelse(youth, "Age 18-24", "Age25+"),
  Region = as.character(region), 
  country = as.character(country))


d_young <- d %>%

    lonely = ifelse(c1_1 == "Yes", TRUE, ifelse(
      c1_1 == "No", FALSE, NA)),
    mh_problems = ifelse(c1_6 == "Yes", TRUE, ifelse(
      c1_6 == "No", FALSE, NA)),
  )

  ) %>%

Are effects within countries as strong as effects between countries?

Logistic regression tells us the strength of the relationship between two
variables.

The first regression shows that the parameter estimate for the relationship
between loneliness and mh is 1.55 (or = 4.72). Adjusting for country, the 
relationship increases to 1.61 (OR 5.02) - the relationship is stronger within 
country than between countries.

```{r}
#| echo: false

fit_1 <- glm(lonely ~ mh_problems, data = d_young, family = "binomial")
summary(fit_1)
exp(fit_1$coefficients[[2]])

fit_2 <- glm(lonely ~ mh_problems + country, 
             data = d_young, family = "binomial")
summary(fit_2)
exp(fit_2$coefficients[[2]])

```


Does the strength of relationship differ across countries?

The analysis below shows that it does.

The first analysis treats country as a random effect, with random intercepts.
The intercepts have a variance - we know this. But the second analysis shows 
that allowing the relationship between mental health and loneliness to vary
across countries improves the model fit (by AIC and ANOVA) suggesting that the
relationship between loneliness and MH varies in strength across countries.

```{r}

fit_3 <- lme4::glmer(
  lonely ~ mh_problems + (1 | country), data = d_young, family = "binomial"
)
summary(fit_3)
AIC(fit_3)

fit_4 <- lme4::glmer(
  lonely ~ mh_problems + (mh_problems | country), data = d_young, family = "binomial"
)
summary(fit_4)
AIC(fit_4)
anova(fit_3, fit_4)

```

## Social Media Use

Using facebook daily has a much stronger association with  feelings of loneliness than it does with mental health problems.

```{r}


d_young <-
  d_young %>% dplyr::mutate(
    facebook_daily = i18_1 == "Every day",
    facebook_daily = ifelse(i18_1 == "Don't know/ Refused", NA, facebook_daily))

d_young <- d_young %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(snapchat_daily = i18_9 == "Every day",
  snapchat_daily = ifelse(i18_9 == "Don't know/ Refused", NA,
  snapchat_daily
  ))


fit_5 <- lme4::glmer(
  lonely ~ facebook_daily + (1 | country), data = d_young, family = "binomial"
)
summary(fit_5)


fit_6 <- lme4::glmer(
  mh_problems ~ facebook_daily + (1 | country), data = d_young, family = "binomial"
)
summary(fit_6)
```

## Interaction between social media and loneliness with mental health problems
Does the relationship between social media use (facebook) and loneliness vary 
depending on the presence of mental health problems? 

This first analysis confirms that those with MH problems are 
significantly more likely to experience loneliness than those without. 
We also find that the interaction between MH problems and daily Facebook use 
does not significantly affect loneliness. This suggests that daily Facebook 
users with MH problems do not experience significantly different 
levels of loneliness compared to non-daily Facebook users with MH problems.

And, are we right to assume that the association between daily facebook usage 
and loneliness do not vary significantly across countries?
Our second analysis shows us that we are. The impact of daily facebook use on 
loneliness does not vary much between countries.


```{r}

fit_7a <- glm(
  lonely ~ mh_problems * facebook_daily, 
  data = d_young,
  family = "binomial"
)
summary(fit_7a)


fit_7b <- lme4::glmer(
  lonely ~ mh_problems * facebook_daily + (facebook_daily | country), 
  data = d_young,
  family = "binomial"
)
summary(fit_7b)
AIC(fit_7a, fit_7b)


```

## Visualizing Loneliness, Mental Health Problems, and their Interaction across countries

predicted_lonely_a <- predict(fit_7a, type = "response")
predicted_lonely_b <- predict(fit_7b, type = "response")


ggplot(d_young_clean, aes(x = mh_problems, 
                          y = predicted_lonely_a, 
                          color = country, group = country)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +

    x = "Mental Health Problems (0 = No, 1 = Yes)",
    y = "Predicted Probability of Loneliness",
    color = "Country"
  )

ggplot(d_young_clean, aes(x = mh_problems, 
                          y = predicted_lonely_b, 
                          color = country, group = country)) +

    y = "Predicted Probability of Loneliness",
    color = "Country"

The first graph has all the countries share two points in each bin 
on the X-axis. This may be

This graph allows us to visualize the strong association between loneliness 
and MH problems (MH being TRUE gives an individual a much higher probability of
being lonely). The slopes being all roughly equal
